# avclickprediction

This is [competition](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/click-prediction/) hosted by Analytics Vidhya.

Train Data is close to 7GB and Test Data is 2GB. I have used Google Cloud Platform to work on this dataset.

* First stored the data in Cloud Storage
* Spinned up a Google Compute Engine with huge memory + SSD
* Used Google Cloud Datalab for interactive development

Note: Even the competition is over, I need to work on improving the model with good features, as the existing model giving huge error.
